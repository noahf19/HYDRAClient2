HYDRAClient2
============

Using the HYDRAClient requires an ImageSleuth account. You may obtain an account at ImageSleuth.com. We offer
free trials to allow you to assess the quality of our service.

Once you set up your user account at ImageSleuth.com, login and access your user dashboard where you will find
the information needed to run the client under the "download" tab.

Once you have download the executable, navigate to the download directory and type:

java –jar  HYDRAClient-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar <base-url> <secret-key> <secret-token> <image dir>

You may run the client in another directory, but you will either have to put the jar file in your classpath or
specify the path to the jar file in the command.

You will be able to get the base-url, secret-key and secret-token from the download tab on your user account.

The ImageSleuth API v1 consists of two non-blocking calls:

    base-url/api/v1/job, which is a post command that sends the image file to the service via the [file] parameter.
        The post command returns a unique job id [id] upon successful upload of the image file.
    base-url/api/v1/results, which is a get command that sends the job id in parameter [id] and retrieves either:
        a 200 code and a results string which represents the JSON results object or
        a code of 202 means that the result is not yet available, so please poll again later.

Each call requires basic authentication, where the secret-key, secret-token represent the user/password respectively.

Note
====

The HYDRAClient2 code is provided as an example of how to access the ImageSleuth web service.
This example is intended for use on folders containing a small number (less than 250) of images as it performs all the Posts
before applying the Gets. A more robust implementation will require running Post and Get commands concurrently, e.g.
submit a number of Posts, then perform Gets to poll for results, as results come back, submit new Posts. We will be
releasing a revised client that can handle larger folders of images shortly.
